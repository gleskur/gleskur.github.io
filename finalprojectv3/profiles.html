        					<h4>Meet COURAGE</h4>
        					<p>This is Courage (also called Wonder and Small Jesus), a young boy with cerebral palsy. Though it often tough for him, he tries to be as mobile as he can, and his energy is being guided by weekly physical therapy he attends with a group of other children the project supports. We first met Courage when he and his mother came into the Kekeli office, and soon we were on our way to get him fitted for calipers. We expect to see him walking in the next few years!</p>

        					<h4>Meet DAVID</h4>
        					<p>Eight year old David has recently undergone a foot drop surgery to correct his foot. He is now walking with crutches and leg braces and causing all sorts of mischief, as little boys should! When we first met David, he wasnâ€™t able to walk, but he is now on the move!</p>

                  <p>Three year old Sedem is a spunky little guy with Down Syndrome. He is in need of a heart surgery to fix a sizable hole in his heart. The Patience Project is currently in the process of fundraising in order to send Sedem to India to receive the type of surgery he needs.</p>        				</div>
